// AES-256-GCM from the standard library. Not a homegrown construction and not
// a dependency: a sealed value is a []byte that goes into a bytea column and
// comes back the same, and the stdlib already has an authenticated cipher.
//
// # What this protects against, and what it does not
//
// It protects against a database dump: a stolen backup, a misconfigured
// replica, a support query that selected too much. The key lives in the
// process environment and never in Postgres, so possessing the rows is not
// possessing the values.
//
// It does not protect against a compromised application process, which holds
// the key by definition. One environment variable decrypts every stored value.
// That is the accepted trade for now; the upgrade is envelope encryption
// against a KMS, and the version byte in the wire format is the seam for it.
